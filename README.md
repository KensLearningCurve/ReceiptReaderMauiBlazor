# ReceiptReaderMauiBlazor

In a previous tutorial (https://kenslearningcurve.com/tutorials/convert-image-to-text-with-azure-computer-vision/) I showed how to read text from images with Azure Computer Vision. The next tutorial shows how to display that result over the image.

Follow the complete tutorial at [https://kenslearningcurve.com/tutorials/azure-computer-vision-part-2-display-result-with-maui-blazor/](https://kenslearningcurve.com/tutorials/azure-computer-vision-part-2-display-result-with-maui-blazor/)

This project uses .NET 6, C#, Micrososft Congnitive Services (Azure Computer Vision), MAUI, and Blazor.

# How it works

Create a Computer Vision resource in Azure Cloud. Get the subscription key and endpoint. Enter those in the ReceiptReader.cs (Data folder).

Start the application, select an image with text, and see the magic happen.
